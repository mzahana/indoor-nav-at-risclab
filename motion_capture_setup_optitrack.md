# Motion Capture setup: OptiTrack


---


The setup of the *OptiTrack* `mocap` includes:
* camera setup (Prime17w)
* system calibration
* software, *Motive*, setup (e.g. creating rigid bodies)

Next, we learn how to stream the position/orientation information of the objects (rigid bodies) to the *Pixhawk* for feedback. This is done using the custom-made streaming application, called OptiStream.
