# Pixhawk OFFBOARD Control Setup



---

OFFBOARD control means that we would like to be able to send (usually) high-level control commands to *Pixahwk*. For example, sending position, velocity , or acceleration set-points. Then, *Pixhawk* will receive those set-points and perform the neccessary low-level control (e.g. attitude/engines control)
