# Motive setup


---

In this section, we mainly want to learn how to 
* Create rigid bodies that represent objects to be tracked (e.g. quadrotor)
* Activate the streaming of rigid bodies information (e.g. position orientation)

Make sure that you have clean markers.
* Markers should not be placed in symmetric shape.
* Markers should not be close to each other.
* Read [this guide](http://wiki.optitrack.com/index.php?title=Markers) for markers setup
* Follow [this guide](http://wiki.optitrack.com/index.php?title=Rigid_Body_Tracking) to create rigid bodies
