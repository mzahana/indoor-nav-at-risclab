# Indoor Navigation and Control at RISC Lab


---


This guide provides the main elements to understand, setup, and perform indoor navigation & control experiments of unmanned vehicles. This is mainly intended for the [Robotics, Intelligent Systems and Control](https://risc.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx) Lab users, at [KAUST](http://www.kaust.edu.sa).

This setup guide is mainly dedicated for quadrotor indoor control using Pixhawk as a flight controller, and OptiTrack as motion capture system, for position and orientation feedback. It will be updated to include other experimental setups as needed.
